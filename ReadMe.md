In this simple player version, you may select any .wav audio file for the playback.
The Basic Player Control, allow you to play, stop or pause. “Please remember to click play”


The red ball indicates the audio sources. You may drag around to feel the effects.

We have also incorporated 2 auto movement button for you, in case you just want to close your eye and listen to the effects.
1.	Distance Movement – the sound source will move in straight line (In and Out) which means the sound source is getting nearer or further from you.
2.	Circular movement – the sound source will be panning around you

The speed of the movement can be controlled by the sliding bar.
